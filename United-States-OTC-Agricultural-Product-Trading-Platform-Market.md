Furthermore, platforms that focus on niche markets, such as organic or specialty crops, may find success by capitalizing on emerging consumer trends and demand for differentiated products.</p><p>Another opportunity is the development of more robust risk management tools tailored to the agricultural sector. While many OTC platforms already offer basic hedging instruments, there is a growing need for more sophisticated products that help market participants mitigate risks such as weather-related disruptions, geopolitical instability, and market volatility.
